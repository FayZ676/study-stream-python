This uses Selenium to scrape the webpage which requires Chrome Webdriver. Make sure you have Google Chrome downloaded and download the correct version of Chrome Webdriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Als update the path in main.py with the path to your Chrome Webdriver.
